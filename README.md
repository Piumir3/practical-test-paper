#Entity-Relationship Diagram
The system is designed based on the following entity-relationship diagram:

Vehicle

Registration Number (unique identifier)
Model Name (not nullable)
Number of Seats (less than 1000)
Is Single Color (boolean, indicating if the vehicle has a single color)
Colors (associated with the vehicle)
Color

Color ID (unique identifier)
Color Name (not nullable)
Vehicle Registration Number (foreign key referencing Vehicle)
Database Schema
The system uses a relational database with two tables:

Vehicle:

RegNo (Primary Key)
ModelName
NumSeats
IsSingleColor
Color:

ColorID (Primary Key)
ColorName
VehicleRegNo (Foreign Key referencing Vehicle)
Features
Add Vehicle: Add a new vehicle with the following details:

Registration Number (unique)
Model Name (not nullable)
Number of Seats (less than 1000)
Single Color or Multiple Colors
Retrieve Vehicles: Retrieve all vehicles in ascending order based on their model names. The displayed information includes registration number, model name,  number of seats , colors.

Validation
The system includes validation to ensure data integrity and accuracy:

Registration number must be unique.
Model name is a required field.
Number of seats should be less than 1000.
Code Structure
The system is organized according to the three-tier architecture with the MVC pattern:

Model: Represents the data model, including entities like Vehicle and Color.
View: Contains the presentation layer, including Razor views for displaying and collecting data.
Controller: Manages the application's flow, handles user input, and interacts with the model and view.
Database Connectivity
A connection class is used to access the database. Entity Framework Core is employed for database operations. It includes code for database context, migrations, and data access.
